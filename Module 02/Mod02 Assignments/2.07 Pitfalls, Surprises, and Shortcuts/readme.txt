**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>:   I learned new shortcuts for manipulating the data stored in variables
<-s>:   I had trouble figuring out why the output was not printing the decimals,
        but I eventually found that I didnt have the type conversion in my code.

a whole instead of taking them 1 step at a time.
